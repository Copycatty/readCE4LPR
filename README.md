the Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) onboard Chang’e-4 (CE-4) ’s Yutu-2 rover
images the subsurface structure of the Von Kármán crater within the
South Pole-Aitken Basin (SPA) on the lunar farside. Low‐frequency radar data carry geological information of about 300 m worth of strata below the traversed path

The scipt is about reading the LPR 2B raw data. Pre-porcessing of the data and migration are on-going.
